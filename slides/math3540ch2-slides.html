<p class="fragment">
A financial transaction may be as simple as making a single deposit, or more commonly, there is a series of deposits and withdrawals before one focuses on the accumulation.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
For example, you would like to save money each month to buy a house, or at least to have the down payment.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
You might have a predictable contribution/expense schedule, the question is when you can buy the house and become a homeowner.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
This is why we study the equations of value in this chapter.

<h4 id="org945ee57">The amount function</h4>
<p>
Let the principal be denoted by \(C\). Then, in the usual notation, the amount function with the <b>compound</b> interest \(i\) reads as
</p>

\begin{align*}
  A_C(T)= C(1 + i)^T\qquad \text{for every } T \ge 0.

The above equation is referred to as the \(T\) time <span style="color: rgb(24,116,205)">equation of value</span>.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
Knowing any three among the values \(A_C(T), C, T\) and \(i\) allows us to calculate the fourth one.

<p>
Find the length of time necessary for \(1,000\) to accumulate to \(1,500\) if invested at \(6\%\) per annum compounded semi-annually.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
<b>Solution</b>
</p>
<p class="fragment">
It is more convenient to think of time-units in this situation as half-years.

Let us denote the unknown number of half-years by \(n\).

Then the equation of value reads as

\begin{align*}
  1000 \left( 1 + \frac{0.06}{2} \right)^n = 1500.

At a nominal interest rate of \(10\%\) convertible quarterly, how long will it take you to double your money?

<b>Solution</b>
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Since the wealth accumulated at any given time is proportional to the principal, we can assume (without loss of generality) that the initial investment is \(1\).

We need to find \(i^{(4)}\) from the equation of value
