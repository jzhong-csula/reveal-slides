<p class="fragment">
A financial transaction may be as simple as making a single deposit, or more commonly, there is a series of deposits and withdrawals before one focuses on the accumulation.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
For example, you would like to save money each month to buy a house, or at least to have the down payment.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
You might have a predictable contribution/expense schedule, the question is when you can buy the house and become a homeowner.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
This is why we study the equations of value in this chapter.

<h4 id="orgee8570b">The amount function</h4>
<p>
Let the principal be denoted by \(C\). Then, in the usual notation, the amount function with the <b>compound</b> interest \(i\) reads as
</p>
<div class="fragment">
\begin{align*}
  A_C(T)= C(1 + i)^T\qquad \text{for every } T \ge 0.

The above equation is referred to as the \(T\) time <span style="color: rgb(24,116,205)">equation of value</span>.

<p class="fragment">
Knowing any three among the values \(A_C(T), C, T\) and \(i\) allows us to calculate the fourth one.

It is more convenient to think of time-units in this situation as half-years.

At a nominal interest rate of \(10\%\) convertible quarterly, how long will it take you to double your money?

<b>Solution</b>
</p>
<p class="fragment">
Since the wealth accumulated at any given time is proportional to the principal, we can assume (without loss of generality) that the initial investment is \(1\).
